# ==============================================================================
# FUNCTION: Allocates memory and reads in a binary file as a matrix of integers
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#   The first 8 bytes are two 4 byte ints representing the # of rows and columns
#   in the matrix. Every 4 bytes afterwards is an element of the matrix in
#   row-major order.
# Arguments:
#   a0 (char*) is the pointer to string representing the filename
#   a1 (int*)  is a pointer to an integer, we will set it to the number of rows
#   a2 (int*)  is a pointer to an integer, we will set it to the number of columns
# Returns:
#   a0 (int*)  is the pointer to the matrix in memory
# Exceptions:
# - If malloc returns an error,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 88.
# - If you receive an fopen error or eof, 
#   this function terminates the program with error code 90.
# - If you receive an fread error or eof,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 91.
# - If you receive an fclose error or eof,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 92.
