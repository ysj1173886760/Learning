#   element of the matrix in row-major order.
# Arguments:
#   a0 (char*) is the pointer to string representing the filename
#   a1 (int*)  is the pointer to the start of the matrix in memory
#   a2 (int)   is the number of rows in the matrix
#   a3 (int)   is the number of columns in the matrix
# Returns:
#   None
# Exceptions:
# - If you receive an fopen error or eof,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 93.
# - If you receive an fwrite error or eof,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 94.
