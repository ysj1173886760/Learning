# =======================================================
# FUNCTION: Dot product of 2 int vectors
# Arguments:
#   a0 (int*) is the pointer to the start of v0
#   a1 (int*) is the pointer to the start of v1
#   a2 (int)  is the length of the vectors
#   a3 (int)  is the stride of v0
#   a4 (int)  is the stride of v1
# Returns:
#   a0 (int)  is the dot product of v0 and v1
# Exceptions:
# - If the length of the vector is less than 1,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 75.
# - If the stride of either vector is less than 1,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 76.
